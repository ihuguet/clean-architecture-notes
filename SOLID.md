SOLID principles goal: creation of middle level software structures that:
- Tolerate the change
- Are easy to understand
- Can be the base of components that can be used in many software systems.

> [!note]
> Although the word *class* is used very often when talking about SOLID, OOP languages are not actually required. A class is just a coupled group of functions and data.

The term "middle level" is used to specify that this principles are used at the [[module]] level. Above it there are similar principles for the component and high architecture levels.

The principles:
- [[Single responsibility principle]] (SRP)
- [[Open-closed principle]] (OCP)
- [[Liskov substitution principle]] (LSP)
- [[Interface segregation principle]] (ISP)
- [[Dependency inversion principle]] (DIP)
