It is not possible to know from the beginning everything that the system will need regarding [[development]], [[use cases and operation]], [[deployment]] and [[maintenance]]. Even the things we know tend to change with the time.

As explained in [[Two values. Features and architecture.]], in software, the value of the structure (architecture) is higher than the value of behavior because it's what makes the software easy to change.

To make the system easy to change, thus adapting to the changes in its requirements, we must try to delay taking decisions as much time as possible, thus leaving options open. A good architecture with good decoupling of its elements will help with this goal too.
