However, it must be noted that these boundaries are costly to implement and to maintain. In some cases it is preferable not to abuse of them, or use only Partial boundaries. They consist on anticipating where an architectural boundary might be necessary in the future but simplifying it so it is easier to develop and maintain.

Although in the Agile community this is often considered as breaking YAGNI (You Aren't Going to Need It), sometimes new boundaries are needed to add and having anticipated it allows the code to change more easily.

Skipping the last step
-----------
We do everything needed to create components that can be compiled and implemented independently but we finally keep them together in a single [[package]]. We have the reciprocal interfaces, the data structures to pass the data, etc. but we keep them within a single [[package]].

The effort to design and develop is the same but you don't have to release separately, administering the version numbers, integrating different versions, etc.

One dimension boundary
--------------
A full architectural boundary uses reciprocal boundaries to maintain the isolation in both directions. However, this is costly, and sometimes a one direction boundary, allowing to have a dependency inversion, is enough for the moment and establish a good point for a future full architectural boundary. However, it has the risk of creating backchannels.

Facades
-----
Instead of creating an interface, a `Facade` class is used. The high level element only operate through this `Facade`, which is responsible of using the low level functions and classes. Dependency inversion is not in place, but we can easily create it in the future.

Note that this actually introduces a transitive dependency from the high level element to the low level ones, making that changes in the low level elements forces to compile again the high level ones. It also introduces high risks of backchannels.
