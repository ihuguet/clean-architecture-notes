Software systems offer 2 values that we want to maintain high:
- Behavior / features: the software fulfills with its purpose
- Structure / architecture: the software changes easily to adapt to new features

Which is more valuable?
- A program that works but is impossible to change won't work when the requisites change, becoming useless.
- A program that doesn't work but is easy to change can be easily fixed to make it work now and when the requisites change, being useful in the short and long terms.

Eisenhower matrix
----------
> There are 2 kind of problems, urgent and important. Urgent problems are not important, and importants are not urgent.

Features are often urgent, but not always important. Architecture is always important but never urgent.

Problems ordered by priority:
1. Urgent and important
2. Not urgent and important
3. Urgent and not important
4. Not urgent nor important

Often we make the error of moving elements from #3 to the same level than #1. Only the software engineers understand and knows the importance of the architecture, it's their responsibility to ensure that it is correctly prioritized.
