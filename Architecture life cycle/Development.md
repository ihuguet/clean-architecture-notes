The architecture must do the development easier for the team. Different project and team sizes will require different architectural decisions.

A small team can tend to monolithic designs without well defined components and interfaces, avoiding complex architectures. This can become a problem when the project grows because it started without any architecture.

A big project with various teams will tend to work on one [[component]] per team. This will ease the development, but it can make harder to implement and maintain.
