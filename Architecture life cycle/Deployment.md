The architecture must facilitate the deployment. It is common not to think about this from the beginning, leading to systems easy to develop but difficult to implement.

A "micro-services" architecture might be very convenient for development in some cases, but at the time to deploy it we can discover that it is very difficult to orchestrate if the number of services is very big.

A good decoupling between components, including the "master" pieces that ties together all the system, will help to facilitate the deployment.
