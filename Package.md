Smallest entity that can be implemented as part of a system. Packages can be aggregated into a single executable, library or dynamic plugin.

*In Java they are the .jar files, gem in Ruby, dll, etc. In interpreted languages, groups of source files that go together.*

Good designed packages always retain the capacity of being implemented and developed independently from each other.
